# Data Cleaning Project

The run_analysis.R script in this directory performs the following tasks

## Tasks common to both training and test data sets

1) read in the names of all the variables from "UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt".
2) read in names of activities as a 'factor' from "UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt".
3) identify variables by name that we are concerned with (those containing "std()"" or "mean()"). 

## Tasks for both TEST and TRAIN data sets

1) read in the measurements from the "X" file.
2) read in associated activities from the "y" file.
3) read in associated subjects from "subjects" file.
4) transform activities by activity factor
5) add 'friendly' column names
6) mutate dataset to add in activity and subject columns

## Tasks to create summary data set

1) combine the TRAIN and TEST datasets into one
2) aggregate combined data by subject and activity, applying the mean() function to other columns
3) apply new column names indicating that values are means.
4) write out data as text file, skipping the row names


## Code Book
